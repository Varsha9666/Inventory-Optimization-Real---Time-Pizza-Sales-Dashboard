# Inventory-Optimization: Real-Time-Pizza-Sales-Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to uncover key business insights and drive data-informed decisions for a fictional pizza restaurant. Using Excel and Python, I cleaned, explored, and visualized transaction-level sales data to understand trends, product performance, and customer behavior.

The project demonstrates my ability to perform end-to-end data analysis — from data cleaning and feature engineering to dashboard creation and insight generation. This type of analysis can help restaurant managers improve operational efficiency, optimize inventory, and enhance marketing strategies.


🧩 Problem Statement:

The pizza restaurant management lacks clear visibility into its sales performance and customer buying patterns. Without proper analysis, it is challenging to:

 📌 Understand which pizza types are most or least popular

 📌 Identify peak and off-peak sales periods

 📌 Track revenue trends across different months and days

 📌 Optimize inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies

To address this, the project aims to analyze historical pizza sales data to uncover insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. This will enable data-driven decisions that can help increase revenue, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.


📍 Key Objectives:

* Track total sales across different time periods

* Identify the most and least popular pizza types

* Examine sales trends by day, month, and time of day

* Highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, order volume, and average order value

* Build an interactive dashboard to visualize insights clearly

📝 Tools & Technologies:

Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, dashboard creation

Power BI / Tableau: (optional) Visualizations and dynamic reporting

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): For deeper data exploration and preprocessing


✅ Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates how data analytics can be applied to restaurant sales data to generate meaningful insights. By analyzing pizza orders over time, we identified best-selling products, peak sales periods, and underperforming items. The findings can support better inventory management, staffing decisions, and marketing strategies.

Through this project, I showcased my ability to:

* Clean and transform raw transactional data

* Perform exploratory data analysis using Excel and Python

* Visualize business KPIs through charts and dashboards

* Translate data insights into actionable recommendations

This analysis serves as a strong example of how data can drive smarter business decisions, even in industries like food and beverage.
